# Performance Plan

## Targets

- Search p95 < 2s
- Checkout/return p95 < 2s
- Dashboard load < 3s
- AI discovery p95 < 5s
- Backend baseline: 1 vCPU, 512MB

## Measurement Plan

- Capture p95 latency and resource usage for search, checkout, dashboard, AI flows.
- Record baseline CPU/memory in a repeatable environment.

## Baseline (to be filled)

| Flow | p95 Latency | CPU | Memory |
|------|-------------|-----|--------|
| Search | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Checkout/Return | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Dashboard | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| AI Discovery | TBD | TBD | TBD |
